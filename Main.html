          <p class="italic-description">"WarGames" is a 1983 film directed by John Badham and starring a young Matthew Broderick. 
            Set during the height of the Cold War, it tells the story of a high school student who hacks into the U.S. military's central 
            computer, which is capable of starting a nuclear war.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="brick">
          <p class="explanatory-text">Those of us who grew up in the 80s and enjoyed the movie "WarGames" will remember how David and Jennifer, 
            after initially stumbling upon what seemed like a video game company, encounter "Joshua," an artificial intelligence trained over 
            the years in different strategy games (Chess, Checkers, Poker, etc.) by Dr. Stephen Falken.</p>
          <p class="explanatory1-text">Without giving away any spoilers, today, after years of training various artificial intelligences 
            developed by brilliant but less tormented minds than Dr. Falken's, we now have, for example, chess engines so powerful that if we 
            play as mere humans, defeat is almost inevitable.</p>
          <p class="explanatory-text">At this point, we might ask ourselves: Is it still worth playing chess, given that even international 
            competitions are being questioned? Should we now delegate decision-making entirely to artificial intelligences trained for this 
            purpose? Can we do anything more than just watch? And if we only observe, are we sure that letting an artificial intelligence run 
            on autopilot is the best option? These are questions we ask ourselves every day now, but they were already being raised back 
            in 1983 with the release of "WarGames," as many of us remember.</p>

        <p class="italic-description">"Moneyball" is a 2011 film directed by Bennett Miller and starring Brad Pitt. 
          Set in the world of professional baseball, it follows the story of Billy Beane, the Oakland A's general manager, who revolutionizes
           the game by using data and statistical analysis to assemble a competitive team on a limited budget.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">It's fascinating to see how, in this new era of artificial intelligence, where new applications and 
          innovations are presented to us daily, we're encouraged to invest in and support the leading companies in the sector and we're 
          gradually being nudged into accepting that decisions can be made by algorithms we don't fully understand. Yet, in business
          leadership, we still seem bound to decision-making models shaped by phrases like "this is how it's always been done" ,"the boss 
          requested it" or "the competition is doing it". Even when we take the time to apply some math, we often resort to static and overly 
          complex Excel based business plans sold at a premium by consultants, these Excels feel more like playing a game of Risk trying to gain
          just 5% more territory with each turn.</p>
          <p class="explanatory1-text">Unfortunately, it's all too common for many business decisions to be made in the following way: 
            First, different assumptions or hypotheses are formed, and then conclusions are drawn, skipping the critical step that Game 
            Theory covers, which is doing the right math before make any decision. Indeed, Game theory provides a rigorous framework that ensures our conclusions follow 
            logically from the assumptions we make.</p>
          <p class="explanatory-text">So, why is it that in the age of artificial intelligence, we still make decisions without doing the 
            right math? It's certainly a difficult question to answer. However, one question we will try to address is this: Can we make 
            better decisions to become better leaders?</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: Game Theory in a Nutshell</h2>
    <div class="brick-container">
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">When starting out with Game Theory, one often encounters the classic Prisoner's Dilemma. However, in 
          keeping with the theme of leadership in the business world, we'll adjust the context to reflect a more relevant scenario the 
          Duopoly Dilemma. In this Dilemma, two dominant payment companies, face accusations 
          from regulators for abusing their market power. Although thereâ€™s little evidence, each company could receive a fine for data misuse. 
          However, if one reports the other, they are exonerated and gain market share, while the accused faces heavy penalties. If both accuse 
          each other, they both suffer severe penalties. If neither reports, both receive smaller fines due to lack of proof. 
          The dilemma mirrors the classic Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma betrayal offers a personal advantage, but mutual defection leads to a 
          worse outcome for both, forcing each to weigh their self-interest against cooperation.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">In this situation, a leader might assume that avoiding cooperation with the regulator is the best 
          choice, believing both companies will gain more by staying silent. However, the math proves otherwise. Game theory shows 
          that this strategy often leads to worse outcomes for both companies, highlighting that non-cooperation is rarely the 
          optimal decision.</p>

        <p class="italic-description">In this matrix, each player has two options: to keep quiet or confess. The dominant strategy here is 
          for both players to confess. This is because, regardless of what Player 1 does, Player 2 minimizes their loss by confessing (0 > -1 &
          -8 > -12), and same for Player 1.</p>

        <p class="italic-description">"A Beautiful Mind" is a 2001 film directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe as John Nash, 
          a brilliant mathematician. The movie delves into Nashâ€™s groundbreaking work in game theory, particularly the concept of Nash 
          Equilibrium, which revolutionized economics and strategic decision-making.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">Game Theory is a mathematical framework for understanding strategic decision-making. It analyzes how 
          individuals, businesses, or even nations make decisions in situations where the outcome depends on the choices of others. At its core,
          provides insights into how rational players can anticipate the actions of others and optimize their strategies 
          accordingly. The key elements are players, strategies, and payoffs. Players have different strategies available,
          and the results (or payoffs) depend on the choices made by both themselves and other players. </p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">  One of the fundamental concepts is the Nash Equilibrium, where no player can gain by changing their 
          strategy if the others remain constant. This equilibrium often explains why certain competitive outcomes are stable,
          even if they are not the most beneficial for all parties involved. </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">  Game Theory can be applied in countless fields such as economics, politics, business, and artificial 
          intelligence. It provides valuable tools for analyzing markets and negotiations by modeling 
          competition and cooperation in a structured way. By understanding the underlying incentives and potential outcomes, Game Theory 
          helps leaders make more informed decisions, paving the way for strategies that account for the actions and reactions of others 
          in competitive environments.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Zero Sum & Perfect Information Games</h2>
    <div class="brick-container">
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">In Game Theory, a <u>zero-sum game</u> is a situation where the gain of one player is exactly equal to the loss 
          of another player. This means that the total "sum" of outcomes across all players always equals zero. These games are typically 
          competitive, with examples ranging from board games like Chess to real-world markets where companies compete for market share. 
          In such a scenario, one companyâ€™s gain results in an equal loss for the competitor. <br> Meanwhile a <u>perfect information game</u> is a game where all players have complete knowledge of the game state at 
          all times. Chess is a famous example of this. At any point during the game, both players know the exact configuration of the board 
          and all previous moves. There are no hidden elements or randomness, unlike games like Poker, where players do not know the cards in 
          their opponent's hands. This distinction makes strategic planning highly crucial in games of perfect information</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">In zero-sum games like Chess, the combination of the Minimax Algorithm and 
          Alpha-Beta Pruning allows players (and AI systems) to make optimized, strategic decisions. These techniques ensure that 
          players can anticipate their opponent's best possible moves and make the most informed decisions.</p>
      </div> 
      <div class="brick">
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="Assets/MinMax.png" alt="MinMax Algorithm" class="chapter-image small-image">
        </div>
        <p class="italic-description">The <u>Minimax Algorithm</u> is a key decision-making algorithm in perfect information, zero-sum games. 
          It operates under the assumption that both players will play optimally, meaning each will make the best possible move to maximize 
          their gains while minimizing the other's. In a game like Chess, this results in players considering all possible moves and responses 
          to find the optimal strategy, which ensures the best possible outcome in the worst-case scenario.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="Assets/AlphaBeta.png" alt="Alpha Beta Pruning" class="chapter-image small-image">
        </div>
        <p class="italic-description"><u>Alpha-Beta Pruning</u> is an optimization technique that improves Minimax by reducing the number of 
          nodes evaluated in the game tree. It "prunes" branches of the tree that do not influence the final decision. This technique is 
          essential for complex games like Chess, where there are vast numbers of possible moves. By pruning irrelevant branches, Alpha-Beta 
          Pruning allows the algorithm to explore deeper into the game, making it computationally feasible to analyze several moves ahead, 
          similar to how grandmasters play.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning have been pivotal in the evolution of AI decision-making strategies. Both 
          algorithms have enabled AI systems to handle complex, strategic decision-making in games by analyzing several possible future moves 
          and counter-moves, which makes the AI excel in planning, reasoning, and adapting to opponentsâ€™ strategies.</p>
          <p class="explanatory1-text"><u>Key AI Milestones:</u><br>
            <strong>Deep Blue vs. Garry Kasparov (1997)</strong>
            <em>Context:</em> Deep Blue became the first AI to defeat a world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.
            <em>How:</em> MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning allowed Deep Blue to evaluate millions of positions per second by focusing on the 
            most promising moves and pruning irrelevant ones.<br>
            <strong>AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol (2016)</strong><br>
            <em>Context:</em> AlphaGo, by Google DeepMind, defeated Go champion Lee Sedol in a five-game series.
            <em>How:</em> Combining MinMax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), AlphaGo navigated Go's vast move 
            possibilities to make superior strategic choices.
            </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">In conclusion, in zero-sum games like Chess as we will see in the next chapter, the combination of the Minimax Algorithm and 
          Alpha-Beta Pruning allows players (and AI systems) to make optimized, strategic decisions.</p>

      <!-- Brick 1: Assigning Numerical Values to Pieces -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          In BattleChess, the AI's decision-making begins with assigning numerical values to each chess piece. These values represent 
          the relative strength and importance of the pieces, allowing the AI to quantify material advantages or disadvantages during the game.
          <br><br>The standard valuations used are:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="Assets/piecesValue.png" alt="Pieces" class="chapter-image small-image">
        </div>
        <p class="italic-description">The oldest derivation of the standard values is due to the Modenese School (Ercole del Rio,
           Giambattista Lolli, and Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani) in the 18th century and is partially based on the earlier work of 
           Pietro Carrera.The value of the king is undefined as it cannot be captured, let alone traded, during the course of the game</p>
        <p class="explanatory-text"> Chess engines usually assign the king an arbitrary large value such as 200 points or more to indicate 
          that the inevitable loss of the king due to checkmate trumps all other considerations. The endgame is a different story, as there 
          is less danger of checkmate, allowing the king to take a more active role.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          These values are fundamental for the evaluation. For instance, if you capture an opponent's 
          bishop (3 points) in exchange for a knight (3 points), the balance remains equal. However, capturing a rook (5 points) 
          for a bishop (3 points) gives you a material gain of <em>5 - 3 = +2</em> points.

      </div>
      <!-- Brick 2: Positional Evaluation with Piece-Square Tables -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          Beyond assigning numerical value to the pieces, the AI evaluates the positions of the pieces using <strong>Piece Square Tables 
          (PSTs)</strong>. This method assign additional values to pieces based on their location on the board, reflecting positional 
          strengths and weaknesses.For each piece type, there is a matrix that represents the board, where each square 
          has a positional value <br> (<em>V<sub>p</sub></em>)= PST<sub>piece type</sub>[rank][file]</p>
          <p class="explanatory-text">Examples of Positional Advantages:
            <ul class="tables-text">
              <li><strong>Pawns:</strong> Advance in value as they move towards promotion; central pawns are more valuable than edge pawns.</li>
              <li><strong>Knights:</strong> More effective in the center (e.g., <em>d4</em>, <em>e5</em>) where they control more squares.</li>
              <li><strong>Bishops:</strong> Value open diagonals and avoid being blocked by their own pawns.</li>
              <li><strong>Rooks:</strong> Prefer open files and the seventh rank, where they can pressure the opponent's position.</li>
              <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Strongest in open positions with many available moves.</li>

          The AI combines the material and positional evaluations into a comprehensive evaluation function. This function calculates a

          Strategic Planning: By calculating the evaluation score for possible moves, the AI can prioritize those that increase
           <em>E</em>, leading to material gains, improved positions, or both. This mathematical approach enables the AI to simulate
            future scenarios and make decisions that align with strategic objectives.

          if at any point <em>&alpha; &geq; &beta;</em>, the AI stops evaluating further moves along that branch because the opponent 
          will not allow that path to occur.

            <li><u>Depth-3 Decision Tree:</u> The AI's evaluation looks three moves ahead in the decision tree, which means 
              it's evaluating the impact of the current move and the next two responses (one from each player). At such a shallow depth, 
              the initial moves of white do not create a significant material or positional advantage over black, leading to similar evaluations.
            </li>
            <li><u>White's Starting Position:</u> In chess, despite moving first, white is not always guaranteed an advantage. 
              The score of -5 suggests that, even from the initial position, the AI estimates that white does not have a clear advantage 
              and might be slightly at a disadvantage.

    <div class="brick-container">
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">We have seen that in Game Theory, a <u>zero-sum game</u> is a situation where one player's gain is 
          exactly equal to another's loss. Poker is a classic example of this because the amount won by one player is lost by the others. 
          This competitive dynamic makes strategic decision-making crucial, as each player's actions directly impact the outcomes of others. 
          However, what adds another layer of complexity is that Poker is also an <u>imperfect information game</u>, where players lack complete 
          knowledge about the game state, often due to hidden information or randomness. In many card games, including Poker, players cannot 
          see their opponents' cards, requiring decisions based on probabilities, intuition, and inference rather than certainty. This 
          uncertainty adds complexity to the game, making strategy and adaptability essential for success.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">The <u>Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CRM)</u> algorithm is a key method for making optimal 
          decisions in imperfect information games like Poker. It works by minimizing "regret" over time, which measures how much better a 
          player could have done by choosing different strategies. By iteratively updating strategies to minimize this regret, CRM converges 
          toward a Nash Equilibrium, where no player can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy. This approach allows players to 
          systematically improve their decision-making process, even in the face of uncertainty and hidden information.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">Typically, Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm would depict a game tree representing 
          possible moves in a game like Poker. The game tree would show: <br>
          <ul class="tables-text">
            <li>Decision Nodes: Points where a player must choose an action.</li>
            <li>Chance Nodes: Points where randomness determines the outcome (like drawing a card).</li>
            <li>Edges: Possible actions or events leading to the next node.</li>
            <li>Regret Values: Annotations at each decision node showing how regret is calculated and updated over time.</li>
          </ul>

          <img src="Assets/pokerCRM.png" alt="Poker Game Tree" class="chapter-image small-image">
        </div>
        <p class="italic-description">In Poker, CRM navigates the extensive game tree of possible moves and outcomes, accounting 
          for all potential actions and counteractions. This allows players (or AI systems) to make decisions that effectively balance 
          risk and reward, even when information is incomplete or hidden. The algorithm's ability to handle uncertainty makes it particularly 
          suited for complex games like Poker.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">This visual representation helps to understand how CRM navigates through the game tree, updating strategies at each node by 
          minimizing regret based on the outcomes of simulated plays. By seeing how the algorithm iteratively adjusts decisions to converge 
          towards an optimal strategy, the complexities of CRM become more approachable</p>

      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">Counterfactual Regret Minimization has been pivotal in advancing AI strategies for imperfect

      <!-- Brick 3: The CRM Algorithm and Strategic Decision-Making -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          <strong>Poker Game Example:</strong><br>
          Suppose the AI considers two actions at a decision point: 'match' and 'raise'. The current regrets (R) are <code>R<sub>match</sub> = 5
          </code> and <code>R<sub>raise</sub> = 3</code>. The strategy probabilities (S) are calculated as:
        </p>
        <ul class="tables-text">
          <li><code>S<sub>match</sub> = max(5, 0) / (5 + 3) = 0.625</code></li>
          <li><code>S<sub>raise</sub> = max(3, 0) / (5 + 3) = 0.375</code></li><br>
          <li>The AI selects 'match' with probability 62.5% and 'raise' with 37.5%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          Suppose the AI chooses 'raise' and receives an actual reward <code>U<sub>actual</sub> = 10</code>. It calculates counterfactual rewards (U) for all actions:
        </p>
        <ul class="tables-text">
          <li><code>U<sub>match</sub> = 8</code> (what it would have earned by matching)</li>
          <li><code>U<sub>raise</sub> = 10</code> (the reward from raising)</li>
          <li><code>R<sub>match</sub> = 5 + (8 - 10) = 3</code></li>
          <li><code>R<sub>raise</sub> = 3 + (10 - 10) = 3</code></li>
          <li><code>S<sub>match</sub> = max(3, 0) / (3 + 3) = 0.5</code></li>
          <li><code>S<sub>raise</sub> = max(3, 0) / (3 + 3) = 0.5</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="explanatory-text">This adjustment reflects the updated regrets and shifts the strategy to consider both actions equally.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          In summary, CRM minimizes regret by mathematically adjusting strategies based on the difference between actual and counterfactual 
          rewards. This enables the AI to optimize its decision-making over time, adapting to the uncertainties of poker by learning from 
          previous outcomes in precise quantitative terms.

            The reason the estimated reward range is so wide is due to the significant variation in outcomes based on different actions. 
            The potential loss in aggressive actions like raising or going all-in reflects the vulnerability of the player's hand. 
            If an opponent holds a stronger hand, the downside risk is very high, hence the negative values.

            Understanding the width of this range is crucial for making an informed decision while aggressive plays might offer potential 
            for higher rewards, they are also much more likely to result in large losses.

    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: Complexity in Iterative Strategy Games</h2>
    <div class="brick-container">
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">There are games like Risk and Catan which are renowned for their strategic depth and complex decision-making
          processes. These games are examples of <u>zero-sum</u> situations, where one player's gain is often balanced by the losses of others. 
          They also involve <u>imperfect information</u>, as players may not know the exact strategies or resources of their opponents. 
          The <u>complexity</u> arises from the vast number of possible game states and the iterative nature of gameplay, where each decision can 
          significantly impact future options and outcomes. Players must plan multiple moves ahead, considering not only their own strategies 
          but also predicting the actions of their opponents. This complexity requires players to constantly adapt their strategies, making 
          these games both challenging and engaging.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">To navigate this complexity, players often rely on heuristics or simplified models to make decisions. 
          However, as the number of possible moves increases exponentially with each turn, traditional decision-making methods become less 
          effective. This is where advanced algorithms like the <u>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</u> come into play. MCTS allows for more 
          efficient exploration of possible game states, enabling players (or AI systems) to make more informed decisions in complex iterative 
          games.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">MCTS builds a search tree incrementally and asymmetrically, focusing on the most 
           promising moves. The algorithm consists of four main steps:<br>
          <ul class="tables-text">
            <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Starting from the root node, select successive child nodes until a leaf node is reached.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> If the leaf node is not a terminal node, expand it by adding one or more child nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Run a simulation from the new node to a terminal state using random or heuristic policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Backpropagation:</strong> Update the values of the nodes on the path from the new node to the root based on the simulation result.</li>
          </ul>

          By focusing computational resources on the most promising moves, MCTS makes complex decision-making more tractable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">MCTS has significantly advanced AI strategies in complex iterative games. By efficiently 
          handling the enormous number of possible game states and adapting to dynamic game environments, MCTS has enabled AI to perform at high
           levels in games previously dominated by human intuition and experience.</p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text"><u>Key AI Applications:</u><br>
          <strong>AI in Chess Engines</strong><br>
          <em>Context:</em> Modern chess engines like Leela Chess Zero utilize MCTS along with neural networks to make decisions.<br>
          <em>How:</em> It helps the AI explore potential moves more efficiently than traditional brute-force methods, leading to 
          superior strategic play.<br>
          <strong>AI in Real-Time Strategy Games</strong><br>
          <em>Context:</em> AI agents have been developed to play complex video games like StarCraft II.<br>
          <em>How:</em> MCTS enables the AI to handle real-time decision-making with imperfect information, considering a vast number of 
          potential strategies and counter-strategies.</p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">In conclusion, Monte Carlo Tree Search represents a significant mathematical advancement in AI and game 
          theory. By utilizing probabilistic simulations and statistical analysis, MCTS efficiently navigates complex decision spaces in

      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          BattlePayRisk introduces new goals centered around economic dominance and strategic investments. Players aim to control high-tier
          markets, maximize incomes, and outmaneuver opponents economically. To assist in making informed decisions, we utilize the Monte Carlo
          Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          The MCTS algorithm enhances gameplay by providing score ranges and recommendations for allocation and attack turns. It simulates
          several game states to evaluate the potential outcomes of different strategies.
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          How MCTS Works in BattlePayRisk:
          <ul class="tables-text">
            <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Starting from the current game state, MCTS selects promising moves based on prior statistics, 
              balancing exploration of new strategies and exploitation of known successful ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> It expands the game tree by adding new nodes representing possible actions, particularly 
              focusing on high-tier countries.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> For each expanded node, MCTS runs simulations (playouts) using algorithms that consider 
              factors like expected income, investment costs, and competition levels. This step predicts the potential outcomes of different strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Backpropagation:</strong> The results of the simulations are propagated back up the tree, updating the statistics 
              associated with each move. This process refines the MCTS's strategies are most effective.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          By leveraging MCTS, BattlePayRisk offers a sophisticated AI assistant that aids in making complex strategic decisions.

      <!-- Brick 1: Mathematical Foundation of the MCTS Algorithm -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          As we have seen before MCTS operates through four main steps, we can understand them deeper right here:
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          <strong>1. Selection:</strong> Starting from the root node (current game state), the algorithm selects child nodes based on the Upper Confidence Bound formula until it reaches a leaf node.
          <br>
          <strong>2. Expansion:</strong> If the leaf node represents a non-terminal state (the game is not over), the algorithm generates possible child nodes (future moves) from this state.
          <br>
          <strong>3. Simulation (Rollout):</strong> The algorithm simulates a random playout from the expanded node to a terminal state, using heuristics to bias towards promising moves.
          <br>
          <strong>4. Backpropagation:</strong> The result of the simulation (win, loss, or score) is backpropagated through the selected nodes, updating their visit counts and total scores.
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          The key mathematical component in the selection step is the UCB formula:
          <br><br>
          <em>UCB = (w_i / n_i) + c * sqrt(ln(N_i) / n_i)</em>
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text"></p>
          <ul class="tables-text">
            Where:
            <li><em>w_i</em>: Total score of node <em>i</em>.</li>
            <li><em>n_i</em>: Number of times node <em>i</em> has been visited.</li>
            <li><em>N_i</em>: Total number of visits to the parent node of <em>i</em>.</li>
            <li><em>c</em>: Exploration parameter (controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation).</li>
          </ul>
          This formula ensures a balance between exploring new moves (high uncertainty) and exploiting moves with high average reward.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Brick 2: Application of MCTS in Evaluating Moves -->
      <div class="brick">

        <p class="italic-description">"The Imitation Game" is a 2014 film directed by Morten Tyldum and starring Benedict Cumberbatch. 
          The movie portrays the life of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician and logician who played a pivotal role in cracking the Enigma 
          code during World War II. Turing's work not only contributed significantly to the Allied victory but also laid the groundwork for 
          modern computing and artificial intelligence.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Conclusion Brick -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">The story of Alan Turing exemplifies the profound impact that mathematical thinking can have on solving 
          complex problems and making informed decisions. Leaders must be cautious not to fall into the trap of drawing conclusions without 
          first engaging in thorough mathematical reasoning. Just as athletes must train consistently to perform at their best, so too must leaders practice 
          and hone their analytical skills.</p>
        
        <p class="explanatory1-text">This dedication to practice aligns with the Greek concept of <em>ethos</em>, which refers to the 
          character and credibility one builds through habitual actions. In leadership, <em>ethos</em> embodies the commitment to making 
          decisions grounded in logic, ethics, and systematic analysis.</p>
        
        <p class="explanatory-text">Moreover, as artificial intelligence continues to advance, our ability to leverage these technologies 
          effectively hinges on our understanding of the underlying math. By doing the right math, we not only enhance our decision-making 
          capabilities but also empower AI systems to perform optimally. This synergy between human insight and "machines" 
          can drive innovation and success in ways previously unimaginable. Ultimately, leaders who embody the <em>ethos</em> of continuous 
          learning and mathematical rigor position themselves and their organizations at the forefront of progress.</p>

      <!-- Brick 1: Deep Dive into Minimax Algorithm in Chess -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          The Minimax algorithm is fundamental in AI for decision-making in two-player, turn-based games like chess. It aims to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario by assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          <strong>Why Min and Max Alternate in Nodes:</strong>
          <ul class="tables-text">
            <li><u>Max Nodes (AI's Turn):</u> The AI aims to <strong>maximize</strong> its advantage, selecting moves that lead to the highest possible evaluation score.</li>
            <li><u>Min Nodes (Opponent's Turn):</u> The AI assumes the opponent will try to <strong>minimize</strong> the AI's advantage, selecting moves that lead to the lowest possible evaluation score for the AI.</li>
            <li>This alternating pattern reflects the adversarial nature of the game, where each player tries to optimize their outcome while considering the best possible countermoves from the opponent.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          In BattleChess, if both players use the best recommendations provided by the AI at the same search depth, the game theoretically results in a draw. This is because:
          <ul class="tables-text">
            <li>Both players are making optimal moves based on the same evaluation function and depth.</li>
            <li>The Minimax algorithm ensures that neither player can unilaterally force a win if the opponent plays optimally.</li>
            <li>The game reaches a state of equilibrium, reflecting a perfectly balanced strategy from both sides.</li>
          </ul>
          This scenario demonstrates the concept of Nash Equilibrium in game theory, where no player can gain an advantage by changing their strategy unilaterally. <br><br> <u>In BattleChess you have a one level advantage.</u>
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Brick 2: Importance of Recommendation Score Range in Poker -->
      <div class="brick">
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          In BattlePoker, the AI uses the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm to make decisions that balance risk and reward. 
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          <strong>Importance of Comparing Score Ranges for Each Decision:</strong><br><br>
          - Each possible action (check, match, raise, all-in) has an associated range of expected rewards based on various factors like hand strength, pot size, and number of opponents.<br>
          - The AI calculates estimated rewards for each action, considering both the minimum and maximum possible outcomes.<br>
          - Higher risk actions (like raising or going all-in) have wider score ranges due to greater variance in possible outcomes.
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          <strong>Using Score Ranges to Make Decisions:</strong><br><br>
          - Players can use the AI's recommended strategies and score ranges to inform their own decisions.<br>
          - By understanding the expected reward range for each action, players can assess their risk tolerance and choose actions that align with their strategy.<br>
          - For instance, a player who prefers safer play might choose actions with narrower score ranges and lower risk, while a more aggressive player might opt for actions with higher potential rewards despite the increased risk.
        </p>
        <p class="explanatory-text">
          By continuously updating regrets and strategies through CFR, the AI adapts to the game's dynamics, providing players with informed recommendations that reflect both potential rewards and risks.

        <p class="explanatory1-text">
          <strong>Imagining Catan with Business Goals in the Global Payments Market:</strong><br>
          - Game Concept: Players act as CEOs of international payment companies, competing to expand their networks, acquire resources, and achieve market dominance in the global payments industry.
          <br>
          - Resource Management: Instead of traditional resources like brick or wheat, players collect assets such as technology patents, regulatory licenses, customer data, and strategic partnerships.
          <br>
          - Building and Expansion: Players establish offices (settlements) and data centers (cities) in key financial regions worldwide, aiming to optimize transaction processing and customer reach.
          <br>
          - Trading and Negotiation: Players engage in deals to exchange assets, form alliances, or negotiate market access, reflecting real-world business negotiations.
